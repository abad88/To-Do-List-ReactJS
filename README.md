# To-Do-List-ReactJS
A Todo List that add, remove and edit data.
To render the data I have just used index.js in the ReactJS and I only have one compenent that is TodoList and its css file that is imported in it. Just download the code and remove all the other files like app.js,app.cs,logo,testing app,report vitals you don't need those files for this code to work.
